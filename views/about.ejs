                <p>Father of 3 humans, 5 unicorns & 2 dogs, I design since I can remember it. I often get asked where I get my inspiration from: in everyday’s lil' details. And sometimes in leftover food I find in my beard.</p>

        <div class="about-description">
            <p>When I was 5, I got abducted by a unicorn family. When they returned me to earth, I joined a designer school. But, fo' real, what I learned with my kidnaptive family really gave an edge to my creative language.</p>

            <p><span class="highlight">Being a human is way too complicated. Time to be a unicorn.</span></p>
            <p>Try it and you’ll see. Then your Figma files are just gonna fly in color, glitter, interactions, and autolayout.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Also, grow a beard. Check my bio if that is not clear.</span></p>
            <p>Available for projects, from Monday to Tuesday, mainly between 14 and 16. (Unless there is a unicorn race on TV - DUH - in that case, come back another day).</p>
            <p>Projects include, RocknRoll covers, furniture refurbishing, Unicorn potty training, and more.</p>
